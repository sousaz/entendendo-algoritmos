## When to use:

When a problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of the same type

When the base case is simple and can stop the recursion

When the depth of the recursion is manageable to avoid stack overflow

## Property
Recursion involves a function calling itself, directly or indirectly, with different arguments

Each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack, which holds the state of that function call
